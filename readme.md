# Popitize

## Overview
Popitize is a full stack web app. it provides a peer space sharing platform for individuals & SMBs to locate and rent space to host their pop-up businesses. With the rise of pop-up shops recently we were passionate about creating this app because it adds value by supporting smaller local businesses (no fixed costs of buying property) and larger businesses gain revenue and efficiencies from their unused property space. 

## Getting Started - To install the application follow the instructions below:
```
git clone
https://github.com/ucb-project-3/popitize.git
npm install
```

## How It Works
**HOME PAGE**: Users identify who they are - renter or host

**REGISTRATION PAGE**: Users register for an account. Renters register by stating their preferences (e.g. pop up category, size, location). Hosts register by stating their preferences (e.g. pop up category, age range, credit rating, location). The account is then created

**HOSTS PAGE**: On the hosts page, users can build their listing. They can fill out details such as Title, Description, Amenities, Location, Host Rules. They can also upload some photos, state their availabilities and decide their rental price. 


**RENTERS PAGE**: On the renters page, renters can find listsings via a search bar and inputting their criteria. They'll see a list of results which they can click into to learn more. Should they decide the listing is what they want they have the option to checkout (via Paypal).
